# Component Conventions

The authoritative guidelines live in the spec repository:
[`lcod-spec/docs/component-conventions.md`](https://github.com/lcod-team/lcod-spec/blob/main/docs/component-conventions.md).

This file remains as a pointer so contributors working from this repository
can find the canonical documentation quickly.
